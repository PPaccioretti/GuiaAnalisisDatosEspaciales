The model involves a Gaussian Field (GF), affected by a measurement error, and a state process characterized by a first order autoregressive dynamic model and spatially correlated innovations. This kind of model is well discussed and widely used in the air quality literature thanks to its flexibility in modelling the effect of relevant covariates (i.e. meteorological and geographical variables) as well as time and space dependence. However, Bayesian inference-through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques-can be a challenge due to convergence problems and heavy computational loads. In particular, the computational issue refers to the infeasibility of linear algebra operations involving the big dense covariance matrices which occur when large spatio-temporal datasets are present. The main goal of this work is to present an effective estimating and spatial prediction strategy for the considered spatio-temporal model. This proposal consists in representing a GF with Matérn covariance function as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) through the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approach. The main advantage of moving from a GF to a GMRF stems from the good computational properties that the latter enjoys. In fact, GMRFs are defined by sparse matrices that allow for computationally effective numerical methods. Moreover, when dealing with Bayesian inference for GMRFs, it is possible to adopt the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm as an alternative to MCMC methods giving rise to additional computational advantages. The implementation of the SPDE approach through the R-library INLA (www.r-inla.org) is illustrated with reference to the Piemonte PM data. In particular, providing the step-by-step R-code, we show how it is easy to get prediction and probability of exceedance maps in a reasonable computing time. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.}, number={2}, journal={AStA Advances in Statistical Analysis}, author={Cameletti, Michela and Lindgren, Finn and Simpson, Daniel and Rue, Håvard}, year={2013}, pages={109–131} }

RK is a spatial interpolation technique that combines a regression of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as land surface parameters, remote sensing imagery and thematic maps) with simple kriging of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called “Universal Kriging” (UK) and “Kriging with External Drift” (KED), where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights. The advantage of RK is the ability to extend the method to a broader range of regression techniques and to allow separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. Data processing and interpretation of results are illustrated with three case studies covering the national territory of Croatia. The case studies use land surface parameters derived from combined Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and contour-based digital elevation models and multitemporal-enhanced vegetation indices derived from the MODIS imagery as auxiliary predictors. These are used to improve mapping of two continuous variables (soil organic matter content and mean annual land surface temperature) and one binary variable (presence of yew). In the case of mapping temperature, a physical model is used to estimate values of temperature at unvisited locations and RK is then used to calibrate the model with ground observations. The discussion addresses pragmatic issues: implementation of RK in existing software packages, comparison of RK with alternative interpolation techniques, and practical limitations to using RK. The most serious constraint to wider use of RK is that the analyst must carry out various steps in different software environments, both statistical and GIS. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling soil properties in 3D benefits from interactions of spatial predictors with soil depth and its polynomial expansion, which yields a large number of model variables (and corresponding model parameters). Lasso is able to perform variable selection, hence reducing the number of model parameters and making the model more easily interpretable. This also prevents overfitting, which makes the model more accurate. The presented approach was tested using four variable selection approaches – none, stepwise, lasso and hierarchical lasso, on four kinds of models – standard linear model, linear model with polynomial expansion of depth, linear model with interactions of covariates with depth and linear model with interactions of covariates with depth and its polynomial expansion. This framework was used to predict Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in three contrasting study areas: Bor (Serbia), Edgeroi (Australia) and the Netherlands. Results show that lasso yields substantial improvements in accuracy over standard and stepwise regression — up to 50 % of total variance. It yields models which contain up to five times less nonzero parameters than the full models and that are usually more sparse than models obtained by stepwise regression, up to three times. Extension of the standard linear model by including interactions typically improves the accuracy of models produced by lasso, but is detrimental to standard and stepwise regression. Regarding computation time, it was demonstrated that lasso is several orders of magnitude more efficient than stepwise regression for models with tens or hundreds of variables (including interactions). Proper model evaluation is emphasized. Considering the fact that lasso requires meta-parameter tuning, standard cross-validation does not suffice for adequate model evaluation, hence a nested cross-validation was employed. The presented approach is implemented as publicly available sparsereg3D R package.}, journal={Computers and Geosciences}, publisher={Elsevier Ltd}, author={Pejović, Milutin and Nikolić, Mladen and Heuvelink, Gerard B.M. and Hengl, Tomislav and Kilibarda, Milan and Bajat, Branislav}, year={2018}, pages={1–13} }

abstract="This paper proposes a methodology to address the classification of images that have been acquired from remote sensors. One common problem in classification is the high dimensionality of multivariate characteristics. The methodology we propose consists of reducing the dimensionality of the spectral bands associated with a multispectral satellite image. Such dimensionality reduction is accomplished by the use of the divergence of a modified Mahalanobis distance. Instead of using the covariance matrix of a multivariate spatial process, the codispersion matrix is considered which have some desirable asymptotic properties under very precise conditions. The consistency and asymptotic normality hold for a general class of processes that are a natural extension of the one-dimensional spatial processes for which the asymptotic properties were first established. The results allow the selection of a set of spectral bands to produce the highest value of divergence. Then, a supervised maximum likelihood method using the selected spectral bands is employed for landscape classification. An application with a real LANDSAT image is introduced to explore and visualize how our method works in practice.",

@article{Cordoba2013,
abstract = {Understanding spatial variation within a field is essential for site-specific crop management, which requires the delineation of management areas. Several soil and terrain variables are used to classify the field points into classes. Fuzzy k-means cluster analysis is a widely used tool to delineate management classes in the multivariate context. However, this clustering method does not consider the presence of spatial correlations in the data. The MULTISPATI-PCA algorithm is an extension of principal component analysis that considers spatial autocorrelation in the original variables to produce synthetic variables. We propose and illustrate the implementation of a new method (KM-sPC) for subfield management class delineation based on the joint use of MULTISPA TI-PCA and fuzzy k-means cluster. To assess the performance of KM-sPC, we performed clustering of the original soil variables and of both spatial and classical principal components on three field data sets. KM-sPC algorithm improved the non-spatial clustering in the formation of within-field management classes. Mapping of KM-sPC classification shows a more contiguous zoning. KM-sPC showed the highest yield differences between delineated classes and the smallest within-class yield variance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

An application in precision agriculture}, volume={44}, ISSN={03704661}, abstractNote={New precision agriculture technologies allow collecting information from several variables at many georeferenced locations within crop fields. The spatial covariation of soil properties and crop yield data can be evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA). Nevertheless, PCA has not been explicitly developed for spatial data as other multivariate descriptive methods. Other multivariate techniques that include spatial autocorrelation among data of neighborhood sites have been recently developed. In this paper, we apply and compare two multivariate analyses, PCA and spatially constrained multivariate analysis methods (MULTISPATI-PCA). The latter incorporates the spatial information into multivariate analysis calculating Moran’s index between the data at one location and the mean values of its neighbors. The results showed that MULTISPATI-PCA detected relations in the data that were not detected with PCA. The mapping of spatial variability from the first principal component was similar between PCA and MULTISPATI-PCA, but maps from the second component were different due to the variance correction by spatial autocorrelation. MULTISPATIPCA method represents a crucial tool to map spatial variability within a field, and to identify homogeneous zones in a multivariate sense.}, number={1}, journal={Rev.
